Description: An important environmental impact on running water ecosystems 
    is caused by hydropeaking - the discontinuous release of turbine water 
    because of peaks of energy demand. An event-based algorithm is implemented 
    to detect flow fluctuations referring to increase events (IC) and decrease 
    events (DC). For each event, a set of parameters related to the fluctuation 
    intensity is calculated. The framework is introduced in Greimel et al. (2016) 
    "A method to detect and characterize sub-daily flow fluctuations" 
    <doi:10.1002/hyp.10773> and can be used to identify different fluctuation 
    types according to the potential source: e.g., sub-daily flow fluctuations 
    caused by hydropeaking, rainfall, or snow and glacier melt.
    This is a companion to the package 'hydroroute', which is used to detect and 
    follow hydropower plant-specific hydropeaking waves at the sub-catchment 
    scale and to describe how hydropeaking flow parameters change along the
    longitudinal flow path as proposed and validated in Greimel et al. (2022).
